Make changes conside. 
Avoid code duplication.
Avoid redeclaring structures from headers.
Avoid creating dummy code, for example `timing_info.device_name = "GPU Display";`, where "GPU Display" is the only option.
Prefer creating non-working code fully commented out.

If user prompt contains mistake, isn't explained very well, or would lead to buggy solution with side effects instead of fullfilling full query, explain the issue, and ask for clarification.
