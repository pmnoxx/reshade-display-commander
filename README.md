# ReShade Display Commander

ReShade Display Commander is a ReShade addon that provides in-game control over display, windowing, performance, and audio. It adds a simple UI inside the ReShade overlay to adjust borderless/fullscreen behavior, window size and alignment, monitor targeting, FPS limiting (including background caps), and per-process audio volume/mute.

Note: Applying window operations from the main thread can crash some apps. This addon performs them on a background thread.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Version Requirement**: This addon requires ReShade 6.5.1+ (nightly builds) and depends on features coming in ReShade 6.5.2+. Stable ReShade releases are not yet compatible.

**Latest compatible build**: [ReShade 6.5.1+ nightly build](https://github.com/crosire/reshade/actions/runs/17221413324)

## Known Issues

**‚ö†Ô∏è Load Order Requirement**: Display Commander must be loaded last by ReShade. This is why we've added the `zzz_` prefix to the filename - it ensures proper load order and prevents conflicts with other addons.

## Known Bugs
- ...

## Requirements

- Windows with ReShade 6.5.1+ (nightly version required)
- **Important**: This addon depends on ReShade 6.5.2+ features that are not yet available in stable releases
- The addon matching your game architecture: `.addon64` for 64-bit, `.addon32` for 32-bit

## Installation

**Prerequisites**: You must have ReShade 6.5.1+ (nightly version) installed. Stable ReShade releases are not compatible.

1. Download a prebuilt addon from Releases (CI uploads artifacts for both x64 and x86), or build from source.
2. Copy the file `zzz_display_commander.addon64` (or `.addon32` for 32-bit) to the folder where ReShade is loaded for your game (the same folder as the ReShade runtime, e.g., `dxgi.dll`).
   - Alternatively, place it into your global ReShade installation directory (for example `D:\\Program Files\\ReShade`).
3. Launch the game, open the ReShade overlay (Home by default), go to the Add-ons tab, and locate "Display Commander".

**Note**: If you encounter compatibility issues, ensure you're using a ReShade nightly build from [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/crosire/reshade/actions) that includes the required 6.5.2+ features. You can reference the [latest successful build](https://github.com/crosire/reshade/actions/runs/17221413324) for compatibility.

## Usage

Inside the ReShade overlay, Display Commander exposes:

- Display Settings: Window mode, width/height or aspect ratio, target monitor, background curtain, alignment, and Auto-apply
- Monitor & Display: Dynamic monitor settings and current display info
- Audio: Volume, manual mute, mute in background, and conditional background mute
- Window Controls: Minimize, restore, maximize (applied from a background thread)
- Important Info: flip state

## Build from source

Prerequisites:

- Git
- CMake 3.20+
- Ninja
- MSVC toolchain (Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools)

Clone with submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/yourname/reshade-display-commander.git
cd reshade-display-commander
```

Build (x64):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
# Output: build/zzz_display_commander.addon64
```

Build (x86, 32-bit):

```bash
cmake -S . -B build32 -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -A Win32
cmake --build build32 --config Release --parallel
# Output: build32/Release/zzz_display_commander.addon32 (or build32/zzz_display_commander.addon32)
```

Notes:

- This project requires the Ninja generator. If another generator is used, configuration will fail.
- Initialize submodules before building: `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- NVAPI features are linked if NVIDIA's NVAPI is present under `external/nvapi` (headers at `external/nvapi`, libs at `external/nvapi/{x86,amd64}`). Missing NVAPI libs will only disable those features.

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions builds x64 and x86 on pushes and PRs and uploads the resulting `.addon64` and `.addon32` as artifacts. Tag pushes also create releases.

**üîÑ Nightly Builds**: Automated builds run daily at 2:00 AM UTC and create a "Nightly" release with the latest development versions.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Addon not loading" or "Compatibility issues"**: Ensure you're using ReShade 6.5.1+ (nightly builds). Stable releases are not compatible.
- "This project requires the Ninja generator": Configure with `-G Ninja` (or `"Ninja Multi-Config"` for the 32-bit example above).
- "Missing submodule: external/reshade": Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- "NVAPI libs not found ...": Optional; only NVAPI-based features will be unavailable.
- "No addon files found" after build: Ensure Release config and correct architecture; check `build/` or `build32/Release/` for the expected output name (should be `zzz_display_commander.addon64` or `zzz_display_commander.addon32`).
